Fix error resulting from

/tmp/servo-hdctools/src/toad/toad.c: In function ‘cmdInitialize’:
/tmp/servo-hdctools/src/toad/toad.c:570:5: error: assuming signed overflow does not occur when simplifying conditional [-Werror=strict-overflow]
     for (i = 1; i < (size_t)serial_size; ++i) {
     ^~~

by using a simple -fno-strict-overflow for now.

There might be a nicer way to solve this, but that requires
understanding better what toad does.
