Subject: [PATCH] debian/multiarch-libs

Allow loading libraries from the local python directory,
as the whole libftdi libraries are private to servo
and also allow them to be multi-arch capable by being named
according to the architecture.

Also don't try to load libftdi.so but instead save the full soname
used when building (like libftdi1.so.2) and use that when loading
libftdi.

Maybe split off that latter change later.
